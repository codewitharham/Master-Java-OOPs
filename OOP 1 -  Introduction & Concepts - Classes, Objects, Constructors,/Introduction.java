        1 . Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

        
        
                
            
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on 
        the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form 
        of fields (attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (methods).
        The primary goal of OOP is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of 
        large software systems.  

                
       

        Key Principles of OOP (will be covered in detail in subsequent OOP modules):

        * Encapsulation: Bundling data and the methods that operate on the data 
                         within a single unit (class).


        * Inheritance: A mechanism where one class acquires the properties and 
                       behaviors of another class.


        * Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on many forms.


        * Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only 
                       the essential features of an object.
