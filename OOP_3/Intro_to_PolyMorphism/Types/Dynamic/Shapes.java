// Dynamic Polymorphism:
// In this example, we demonstrate dynamic polymorphism using method overriding.
// Dynamic polymorphism is achieved through method overriding.
// In dynamic polymorphism, the method to be executed is determined at runtime.
// This is done by defining a method in a superclass and overriding it in subclasses.

// Example:

// Dynamic Polymorphism in Java using Method Overriding
// This code demonstrates dynamic polymorphism through method overriding.
// It includes a class `Shapes` with a method `draw`, and subclasses `Circle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle` that override the `draw` method.


package OOP_3.Intro_to_PolyMorphism.Types.Dynamic;

public class Shapes {
    
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }

}
